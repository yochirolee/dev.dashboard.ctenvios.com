# Stack and tooling

- Framework: React 19 with TypeScript.
- Build tool: Vite.
- State/data libraries: TanStack React Query.
- HTTP client: Axios.
- UI: shadcn/ui (Radix-based components).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Guidance
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase for component structure, hooks, and file organization.
- Prefer the established stack above instead of introducing new overlapping libraries.
