# Data fetching (React Query + Axios)

- Use TanStack React Query for server state (queries/mutations, caching, invalidation).
- Use Axios for HTTP requests.

Guidance
- Mirror existing query key patterns and request helpers already used in the repo.
- Keep request/response typing explicit in TypeScript.
